Read the codes (especially the comments behind it) first before you read the corresponding parts of this document
All codes are taken from the book linked to this github file. In order to fully understand, look up the chapters


1st:

The python interpreter used is pycharm
The 3 imported libraries are downloaded seperately, they are not in the interpreter download by default

2nd:
The code needs to be converted to gray and shown gray, otherwhise the code will be shown in BGR (look 3rd)


3rd:
photos are shown usually in RGB (Red, Green Blue), however you can use multiple photo plotting options
np.hstack sticks images together into one image, approximately

4th:

The Gaussian filter is a process in which an x by x kernel matrix is shifted over all the pixels in the picture. 
The matrix is Gaussian means that the middle point of the matrix is biggest and all other points around it get gradually smaller 
to mirror a gaussian distribution when you look at it from the bird perspective.
As the matrix shifts over the pixels the middle pixel becomes the average out of all the pixels around it to smooth the image.

5th:

A histogram equalization takes the color spectrum that is highest in the picture and makes a function where this spectrum is highest. 
Then, it somewhat equalizes this function by increasing the colorspectrum that is 'too' low relative to the global maximum of the function.

6th:

Sobel - Shift a specific kernel matrix over the first derivative of the pixel matrix (that is the image) and average it to the kernal matrix
Laplacian - same as with the Sobel but use the second order drivative of of the pixel matrix (that is the image) and average it to the kernal matrix

7th:

Corner detection is a score function of a matrix that is shifted over the image and if the score is sufficiently high it returns a corner

8th:

Fast features s a circle of 16 pixels around a central pixel and if the colorspectrum the pixels around the midpixel is sufficiently
different from the threshold set a feature is detected 

9th:
