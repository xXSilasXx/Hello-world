Read the codes (especially the comments behind it) first before you read the corresponding parts of this document

1st:

The python interpreter used is pycharm
The 3 imported libraries are downloaded seperately, they are not in the interpreter download by default

2nd:
The code needs to be converted to gray and shown gray, otherwhise the code will be shown in BGR (look 3rd)


3rd:
photos are shown usually in RGB (Red, Green Blue), however you can use multiple photo plotting options
np.hstack sticks images together into one image, approximately

4th:

The Gaussian filter is a process in which an x by x kernel matrix is shifted over all the pixels in the picture. 
The matrix is Gaussian means that the middle point of the matrix is biggest and all other points around it get gradually smaller 
to mirror a gaussian distribution when you look at it from the bird perspective.
As the matrix shifts over the pixels the middle pixel becomes the average out of all the pixels around it to smooth the image.
