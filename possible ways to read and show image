import cv2                   #import open-cv library into python
import plotlib.pyplot as plt #import plotlib library into python

# first way:
img_name = 'name of image'   # paste initial image into python project to be access it with its name
image = cv2.imread(filename) # image is now a variable
cv2.imshow(image) # save image to be displayed
cv2.waitKey(0) # display image on screen and terminate program once the display is closed
cv2.destroyAllWindows() # terminate windows fully(optional)

#second way:

img_name = 'name of image'
plt.imshow(img_name)
plt.axis('off')        # take off axis from image
